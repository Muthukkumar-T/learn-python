# Fast paced introduction to Python for data science
This repository consists of notes and resources used in our cohort's journey
into learning Python with applications in data science. 

> Python is an elegant programming language and is a worthwhile tool to add 
> to your toolbelt for fun or profit or simply to gain a-ha moments in life.

There are literally thousands of hours of videos, tutorials, and articles
about Python. Pick anything that speaks to you and get started. Some of the
more standard websites of repute that can be used as jumping points are
listed under [Resources](#Resources).


## Prerequisites (in order)
1. A weekly commitment of at least a couple of hours to do `hands on` coding
2. GitHub Account ([sign up here](https://github.com/signup) here if don't have one already)
3. [Sign up to `replit`](https://replit.com/signup) using `your github account`

Prior programming or cooking experience helps but is not a requirement.

## Resources
- [The official website of Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/index.html)

## What will we be learning
The syllabus is not fixed. We are going to discover the paths that lead 
us into the application of Python for data analysis, investing, and  
automation.

A minimum threshold for success (for this cohort) is to be able read and 
enhance code written by others. A wildly successful outcome is to be able
to build a portfolio dashboard, automate an investment pipeline or anything
else that may tickle our imagination.
