# FinPack
This directory contains the beginnings of a useful collection of
finance related functions that we will develop as we progress.

Curently it has been setup as an assignment to be completed by 
the cohort. Copy the shell code to your repl.it and fill in the
missing parts of the code.

`main.py` contains the driver code to invoke `avg` function in the
finpack module. The `avg` accepts a stock symbol (in USA markets),
fetches the data using `yfinance` API and computes the average of the
the closing price.
