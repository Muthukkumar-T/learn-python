# Exploring Python (on your own)
Python is an `opinionated` programming language. So much so that it has its
own [`zen`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/).

You can find the `what` and `why` of Python by reading up on
`PEP`s - [Python Enhancement Proposals](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000/).

The best way to learn Python is to simply dive in. And that's what we did
this week. We covered the basic syntax and some gotchas. Here are a few
worth reiterating.

**White space matters:** Python doesn't care about tabs or spaces, only that
you remain consistent in using either or and indent correctly to inform it of
the structure of your code. You can read more about `white space` and the 
`prefered` style to writing Python in [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

**Syntax errors help you learn Python faster:** While they can be annoying
and even frustrating at first, encountering and resolving syntax errors is
the best way to get comfortable with Python. And you only get them when you
write code ;-)

**Use the source:** to learn Python (as much as possible)...
- [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/index.html)

When searching for a topic on Python, remember to suffix your search by adding
`docs.python.org` for a direct hit.

## Assignment
- Download and print [Python 3.x Cheat Sheet](https://perso.limsi.fr/pointal/_media/python:cours:mementopython3-english.pdf).
- Try out the basic syntax provided in the cheat sheet on your `replit`.
- Grading is done by the amount of syntax errors collected: 
  - 0   syntax errors: F
  - 1   syntax errors: E
  - 2   syntax errors: D
  - 3   syntax errors: C
  - 4   syntax errors: B
  - 5+ syntax errors: A
- Post your syntax errors in the group to claim credit ;-)
